PMAPscore (CRAN)
  - Purpose: Conceptual and code basis for SPIA-style pathway scoring adapted in RIPPLET

  - Upstream authors: Junwei Han; Yalan He; Xiangmei Li
  - URL: https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=PMAPscore
  - Notice: Portions of RIPPLET’s pathway-level code are derived from PMAPscore (we choose GPL-3 for those parts). The combined work is distributed under AGPL-3.0-or-later, which is compatible with GPL-3-licensed components.

List of Adapted Files/Functions from PMAPscore
----------------------------------------------
Derived elements (with substantive modifications and rewrites):
  - R/get_pps.R
      * Based on PMAPscore::newspia() logic; adapted to accept RIPPLET gene scores,
        support sparse solves, explicit NA handling for singular systems, and uniform
        output tables (Pathway, sumpfs).
  - R/norm_graphs.R
      * SPIA-style normalization adapted for RIPPLET, including dampening for near-singular
        systems and standardized naming/INFO outputs (invertible flag, sizes, etc.).
  - R/get_npps.R
      * New in RIPPLET: converts PPS tables to a normalized pathways×samples matrix
        using per-pathway MaxHit denominators (computed via RIPPLET’s get_pps_max_hit()).
  - R/ripplet_path.R
      * New in RIPPLET: wrapper around get_pps() and get_npps().

  - Original work © the PMAPscore authors and contributors.
  - RIPPLET authors selected the GPL-3 option for the adapted PMAPscore portions.
